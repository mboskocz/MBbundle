#' Response Time Moving Windows Function for Correlation with Plausible Values
#'
#' This function computes the (unweighted) correlation of a variable with PISA scores 
#' which are computed based on all Plausible Values across time using the moving window approach method.
#' This method analyzes response time windows of a set length and moves
#' the windows by a specified jump. This creates overlapping intervals which
#' allows to see how an observed variable develops over time. The smaller the
#' window, the more detailed observation of the development of the variable.
#' This function performs the analysis in individual windows and provides you
#' with a table with a result for each investigated time interval.
#' This function assumes that Plausible Values are labeled as PVXSUBJECT (e.g. PV1MATH, PV2SCIE...).
#' It also assumes that variable does not contain NA codes. Predefined values are in milliseconds.
#'
#' @param data Here input the data frame which contains needed variables.
#' @param timeVarLabel String. The name of the time variable.
#' @param cor1 String which contains the variable name for which you want the correlation value.
#' @param PVtype String which contains information on which Plausible Values you want to use â€“ the variable ending (e.g. math, scie, read...). 
#' @param timeStop Number. Indicates the end time of your analysis.
#' @param timeStart Number. Indicates the starting time of your analysis. Defaults to 0.
#' @param intLength Number. Indicates the length of the time window. E.g. If your time variable is in milliseconds then value 2000 will mean 2s intervals (e.g. 0-2, 0.1-2.1, etc.). Defaults to 2000.
#' @param windowShift Number. Indicates by how much the window will shift. E.g. If your time variable is in milliseconds then value 100 will mean shift by 0.1s (e.g., 0-2, 0.1-2.1, etc.). Defaults to 100.
#' @param endInclusive Boolean. If TRUE then the time intervals will be inclusive of the end of each interval window (e.g. 0-2s inclusive of 2s but not of 0s). If FALSE, then it is inclusive of the beginning (e.g. 0-2s, inclusive of 0s but not of 2s). Defaults to TRUE.
#' @param PVnumber Number which represents the number of Plausible Values. Defaults to 10.
#' @param minObserv Number. Represents the minimal number of observations required for the correlation to run. If not reached, returns NA. Defaults to 40.
#' @return Data frame which contains the correlation value and confidence intervals for each investigate time interval. First column indicates the investigated time interval. >/< indicates which number is inclusive in the time interval
